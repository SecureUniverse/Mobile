## OWASP
- API security in backend
- Profiling & passive monitoring in SOC
  - Find security bridges and api hook
- Obfuscation
  - MSTG-RESILIENCE-5 
  - DexProtector (better than ProGaurd & DesxGaurd)
    - Just some function of app should be obfuscated 
  - Frida Hooking (Objection)
- Root & Jailbreak detection
  - Frida is possible to work non-root (very advanced)
  - 90% of apps use RootGear
